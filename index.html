        <p>
            Right from the first few websites and software projects of my childhood, to my active involvement in professional organizations and startups, I have developed a work hard, play hard mentality.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m an ambitious, self-motivated, and versatile individual. I am able to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment and manage multiple software projects simultaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
            May it be, co-founding Doctor Caos, at the tender age of 15, or developing software solutions to solve the employability problem or my other projects in the education and entertainment sector, I have always been recognized as a versatile software developer who is able to get things done, and get them done with passion and flare. I aim high, and I stay relentless till I achieve the goals I have set, be it obtaining quarter of a million monthly view within a year, obtaining clients in 100+ countries or building one of the most powerful and highly scalable automation platform for 3rd party service integration.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you find my work or consultation useful you can buy me a coffee.
        </p>
